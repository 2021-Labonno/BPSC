           It  is  with  pride  that  BEPZA  Public  School  &  College  will  take  the  responsibility 
            of  promoting  education  not  only  among  the  offspring  of  parents  serving  at  BEPZA  and 
           the  enterprises  of  Dhaka  EPZ  but  also  among  the  students  residing  in  the  surrounding   area.
            With  this  motto  in  view,  this  institution  was  established  on  15  December,  1999.  Since  the
             inception , the  institution  has  been  able  to  extend  its  range  of  service  to  a  greater  level 
             starting  with  only  275  students  to  a  current  range  of  2976  students. </div>
