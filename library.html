    <i>
        With an aim to assist the students with academic learning and even to help the students get a way out from the boundary of mere bookish knowledge at times, BEPZA Public School & College has a well furnished library. The library started its journey in February, 2001 with 600 books alongside the garage of DEPZ which later on got shifted to the newly constructed school building and the facility of books increased over 1000 in number. Initially the library was supervised by Senior Teacher Md. Sarwar Hossain. Afterwards, the library activities started to its fullest potential by creating a post of Librarian in 2003 according to the rules of the organization. Eventually it was transferred to the ground floor (Room no-104) of the newly constructed college building in 2019 under the supervision of Asst. Teacher Muhammad Firdaush Ahmed (Library & Information Science). At present the total number of bookshelves is 8 and the library can facilitate the students with around 3200 books. Every year a budget is sanctioned to collect new books as per the demand of the students and teachers. In order to add to the vibrant color of the library, a new section is added named ‘Bangabandhu Corner’ dedicating to the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There are 2 almirahs containing 47 books and 6 photo frames of the Father of the Nation in the<b> ‘Bangabandhu Corner’.</b>

Students opting to borrow books from the library are supposed to have library card provided by the institute. They can even keep the books at home for a certain period of time with an entry of their card number to the register of the library.
