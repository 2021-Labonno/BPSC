    <img src="imaga.html/bepza22.jpeg" width="100%">
    <p>Games and sports are very similar:<br> a game is a physical or mental activity or contest that has rules and that people do for pleasure. A sport is a contest or game in which people do certain physical activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other.<br>

The difference is subtle. A game is any mental or physical activity with rules that is done for fun, such as physical activities like baseball and soccer, or board games such as chess and Monopoly, or card games, or electronic games (like apps), or video games. Sports are specific physical activities one can compete in such as baseball, soccer, football, field hockey, running, cycling, rock climbing, swimming, diving, race car driving, kayaking, or weight lifting. There are many more games and sports than what is listed here. Below are some examples of 'game' and 'sport' in sentences:<br>

A game can also be a specific instance of a sporting event. Below are some examples:<br> <br>
