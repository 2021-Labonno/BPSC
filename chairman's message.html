    Greetings to all the members of BEPZA Public School & College family, well wishers and visitors!

It gives me a great pleasure to welcome you to BEPZA Public School & College Website. Creating a website means creating an online resource with all relevant information where we can get to a platform together and stand alike together which I hope to be fulfilled as you peruse through the content of this website.

We all know that the Government of Bangladesh has given special emphasis on the application of digital technologies to make the dream ‘Digital Bangladesh’ come true. With regard to the government, the initiative taken by our institute is certainly praise worthy. I firmly believe that through this Website the institution will be connected with the other institution of Bangladesh even with the whole world socially, academically and even culturally. Finally, I reiterate the firm conviction that the teacher and staff of BEPZA Public school and college will ceaselessly work together towards making this institution an ideal one.

We look forward to continuing to serve and support all of you in our efforts to exceed expectation.

Thank you for taking the time to visit our website.
