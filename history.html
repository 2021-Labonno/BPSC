The institution started its journey with only two hundred and seventy five students on 15 December, 1999.

    Although the institution started off with only 275 students, at present the number has increased over three thousand, 3117 to be precise. Twenty five percent of students, among them, are the offspring of parents serving at BEPZA and the enterprises of Dhaka EPZ.
