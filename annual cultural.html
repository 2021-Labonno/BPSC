  <h1>Annual cultural program</h1>
  <h4>Cultural Week:</h4>

To give the students a complete relief from the boredom and monotony of so called competitive environment of education and to give a spark in the latent talent of co-curricular activity, Cultural Week is about to be held for the very first time in our institution under the direct consent of the Hon. Chairman. A week of detachment from study is not such a big deal as far as education is concerned but will certainly be a great stride ahead for their dormant and extracurricular creativity. This ardent desire is about to be fulfilled through a series of activities like:

<h4>Brain Trust Competition</h4>
Science Olympiad
Extempore Speech (Bangla / English)
Spelling competition (Bangla / English)
Recitation or Chanting from Koran or other religious scriptures.
Music
Dance
 

<h4>Inter-House Annual Sports and Cultural Competition:</h4>

Every year Inter-House Annual Sports and Cultural Competition (on dance, music, recitation-literary & Holy Quran, extempore speech, debate, rhymes for kids, drawing etc) is organized by different houses in a befitting manner in accordance with the academic calendar. Executive Chairman, BEPZA & Chairman, Governing Body of our institute, usually chairs the function.

     

      <h4>Prize Distribution Ceremony:</h4>

      Students’ showing excellences in their respective fields are awarded prizes. You will be happy to mark that Executive Chairman BEPZA usually hands over the prizes in person among the students through a colorful function in order to encourage them for further development.

 

     <h4>Other activities:</h4>

                Orientation for newly admitted students, Fresher’s Reception, farewell for SSC & HSC Examinees are held. Besides, International Mother Language Day, National Mourning Day, Shaheed Dibash, Independence Day and Victory Day celebrations are held with proper solemnity and dignity.
